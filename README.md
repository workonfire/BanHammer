# BanHammer

An incredibly simple ban hammer plugin, used by me just for testing some mechanics.

Use `/banhammer` or `/bh` to give yourself an ultimate banning tool. Just try to fight a player with it and he'll get banned.

## Permissions
- `banhammer.get` - used for `/bh`
- `banhammer.notify` - used for receiving ban notifications
